# bots
For assignment 5, I tried to recreate Boston Dynamics's Spot in pybullet. The fitness function for the robot is essentially how far the robot travels from the origin. A robot with a low fitness would stay near the origin from where it spawns, but a robot with a high fitness would go as far as way as possible, within the time limit of the program running. Essentially (posX)^2 + (posY)^2
